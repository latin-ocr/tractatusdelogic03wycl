XII INTRODUCTION.

of inovement ‘varied in the subject’ comes in. Movement variably varied
may be so in infinite manners, and endless new species of movement are
thus conceivable. At this stage of the enquiry, Wyclif proposes three
questions; the first, dealing with succession‚ is to be solved in the follow-
ing chapter3 the second concerns the Confinuous, and the third, the
measure of velocity os motion, and will be answered here (29, 30).

Is the Continuons made up of points? Argumcnts pro. ——— If the
world consists of atoms which in their turn consist of indivisible points‚¹
how can we explain the existence of the Continuous, which is indefinitely
divisible? How can the Extended be made up of elements which are
in no wise extended? But Wyclif says that it must be so⁷ and gives
seven arguments to prove it. —- Ι. The intrinsic cause of anything is
necessarily a part of that thing; now points cause lines, lines surffices,
and surfaces volumes3 thus points are parts of space, and it is ulti—
mately composed of them, — 2. Either points are not, or they are, parts
of lines3 if not, all the points in a line could be taken away without
shortening it: a manifest absurdity. ω 3. If two bodies touch in one
point only, we have two points which touch one another, and yet are
distinct (as belonging to different bodies); that is, they are not in the
same place. So we see that ‘to touch’ does not mean ‘to coincide³‚
and the possibility of space consisting of contiguous points is saved
(30, 31). — 4. An instant is to divisible continuous time what a point
is to a divisible continuous line3 but one instant is not identical with the
next immediately following it: consequently, neither is one point identical

with another that it touches. And if so, the point is, not the negation,

but the element of the Continuous (31). — 5. Α mobile, passing through
two surfaces that touch — air, v, g. and water ——- will pass one after

the other, and touch each of them at two indivisible instants of time,

distinct, though not separated by any interval. Other suppositions lead

1 Boskowitch's theory of indivisible points —- mere mathematical centres of
attracticn — which is well-known to the philosophical worldv would seem some-
what similar to that of Wyclif. But there is an enormous diss'erence. Boskowitch's
atoms clo not touch, thcy cannot touch3- they act upon each other with atti-active
and repellent forces through a perfect vacuum. Thus his theory, though lying open

to other objections7 cannot be assailed by those which Wyclif here undertakes
to restite.
