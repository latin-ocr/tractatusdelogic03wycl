XVIII INTRODUCTION.

of space were filled with indivisible impenetrable atoms, should anything
increase in size‚ the whole universe would become larger than it can
possibly be. Yet rarefaction must be admitted; and a like argument has
the same weight as regards condensation. Wyclif, in his reply‚ at once
declares that he does not admit the possibility of a body occupying
more or less space without gain or loss os matter. Rarefaction‚ there-
fore, and condensation also, are denied in this sense, but admitted in
another. On account of the accession or the removal of another body,
a substance may seem to increase or diminish in size3 as, v. g., smoke
seems to spread itself out and fill a room, whereas it is in reality mixed
with the air. This is the only sense in which rarefaction is possible,
and it answers all the objections. We need not follow our author through
the mazes of Mediaeval physics which he threads, nor inquire whether
this view would destroy all difference between the elements of fire, air,
water and earth (63—70). Wyclif ends by stating, as his opinion, that
the compenetration of two bodiesis an utter impossibility. This conclu-
sion evidently flows from his doctrine. Two points, having no dimensional
qualities -— nothing but position —- would, if they coi'ncided, lose even
that essential quality, and be nothing at all. But it raises grave theolo-
gical difficulties; for the School generally admits that God's Omnipotence
can make two bodies occupy the same space.

objections drawn from tlzeology. Since spiritual forms, having more
perfect entity than matter, can occupy the same space with it, then α
fortiori matter can be coextended with matter. Resides, the glorified
bodies of the Saints possess the gift of subtlety, i. e,³ of passing through
matter3 which seems to imply compenetration. — The answer is a
repeated denial of its possibility (71). The gift of subtlety, bestowed on
glorified bodies, is somewhat perplexing; but there are various ways of ex-
plaining it without admitting compenetration (72, 73).

objections drawn from cltemical combination. — lf every punctal
atom is and remains eternally the same, then the elements would remain
in their compounds; size would be made up of that which has no size‚
and movement of what is not properly movement, as one point passes
instantaneonsly into the place of another. -—- The first of these con-
clusions is granted by Wyclif, though the question itself was, during the
whole of the Middle Ages, a battle-field for the rival sections of the
School. The Thomists maintained that in all chemical combinations‚
