INTRODUCTION. XXV

in different parts. No quality is essentially inherent to primordial inatter;
therefore, nothing can contradict it. A body composed of parts which
come and go successively may receive different and contrary qualities‚
and yet remain the same; as, v. g.‚ the Mediterranean may ebb and
flow, and yet be the same sea (124-127). Thus, when we say, This
is hot, we speak of the compound alone; it is that which is hot; Here
comes a digression. How can heat, the proper quality of fire, be found
in water, which is naturally cold? Particles os fire may be mingled with
the water, though they are in a violent state3 the water, if left to itsel-f,
will soon again become cold. However mingled the different elements
may be, they still obey the laws which govern their nature (128—130).
The chapter closes with a short survey of creation‚ beginning with the
elements which, uniting‚ form vapours; these produce metals and earths;
the earths, if mingled with fire and water, bring forth plants and also
animals in an ascending scale of forms, the lower hardly distinguishable
from inanimate beings, the highest, quasi-immaterial. The soul of man
is completely so; and each higher form includes in its perfection that
of the lower ones (130-132).
