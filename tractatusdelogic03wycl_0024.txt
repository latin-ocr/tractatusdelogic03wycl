XX INTRODUCTION.

each other until the final evolution of the elements. All this time the
elements were iu potentia -- remotissima, remota, proxima,· then
in actu primo νεηιοίο, in czclu primo proximo, and at last in actu
secundo.

Wyclif continues to urge the point against his adversaries. If we
gel the elements out of the compound, they must have been there before;
and many instances <go to prove that they actually exist there; for
instance, the phosphorescence of fishes⁷ scales in the dark is attributable
to the actual existence of sire (77). And as a fact, we find in combina-
tions the same qualities as were before in the elements; or if not, a
mean between them; or their reaction in the compound may even pro-
duce a quality. There is no need to suppose that the former qualities
are destroyed because they do not appear (78, 79). I have added the
last clause as the answer of such philosophers as dispute with the
modern Thomists‚ who point out that carbon, hydrogen‚ and nitrogen
are harmless, and that prussic acid is a violent poison. The poisonous
quality is merely the reaction upon each other of various qualities os
the three component elements⁷

To this the adversaries reply that such a compound would be but
a mere aggregate of atoms ‘which a man that had the lynx's eyes might
see separate'. Wyclif's answer is that of the modern chemical school;
they are not mere aggregates: mlta! diſj‘erenliales the componun( is the
relative position os one asom lo cenomm- (80). But, it is urged, if the
elemental forms are everywhere in the compound‚ the superadded form
os [lte compomzd must be nowhere. Wyclifreplies that this form is every-
where in the whole, and to a certain extent, indivisibly SO, being less
material than the elementary forms, There is something of the universal
in these higher forms, which exist partially in each atoni, considered as
part of the compound (So—81). —- One last difficulty. ln this system,
the whole world is one being; and one only, since all points touch,
from the centre to the extreme point where space censes to be possible.
—- It is quite true, answers Wyclif, that the world is one being3 but it
does not follow that everything in the world is one. One being may be
separated from another by a third. Continuity does not mean sameness
of nature. Every part of the world joins in and aids the harmonious
action of the whole; all things are made for man, and it is for that

reason that all the elements concur to form his organs of sense, and
