from the varying senses of the word together. Two things may be said
to be together, i, e. both occupying exactly the same space (an abso-
lute impossibility) or contiguous, each being in different places, or both,
though separate, being contained in the same larger space. As to time,
absolute simultaneity is possible (157). This answers most of the objec-
tions. Always may be understood as meaning eternily, or during all
eternh‘y, or in some part of all eternity. The last sense is of course
widely different from the others, and in this sense alone, whatever is
future or past is always (158). We may see a thing, though we do not
see the whole thing; just so, a man may exist in the Xth century, though
non-existent during a part of the ΧΗ] century (158, 159). To maintain
this, however, we must say that time consists of instantaneous elements.
For, if instants are not parts of time, then instantaneous events (such
as cognition, division, ἃς.) could not be said to exist at any time, having
no duration. And if not at any time, their contradictories would be true
in all time, notwithstanding that they also would be true. It cannot be
said that, from non-cognition to cognition, there is a change which im-
plies time3 for from one contradictory to another, there is no real change.
That which is not white now, if at any time it is to become white, cannot
receive the predicate of mere non-whiteness: so non-existence in a part
of time is not non-existence in that time. After death, a man is neither
simply non-existent nor existent: he is non-existent then (160, 161).
Corollaries. —- Time, the duration of the world, began with the
world, and with it must last eternally; necessary to the creation of.
the world, it does not depend on anything but the general fact of move-
ment. It consists of indivisible instants as its elements; these are abso-
lutely without magnitude, and time itself is everywhere, indivisibly the
same throughout the universe (162). As the world is everywhere, so is
time, and so is God (163). What begins and ends in time (as cor-
ruptible entities); what makes up the very essence of time (as an instant);
what has modes of being measured by time (as the heavens), may be
called temporal, but in different senses (163, 164). Time is in itself a
cause of dissolution‚ sor it causes things to grow older; but occasionally
it is a cause of production, since it renders their production possible. Its
very essence is change, and no two os its parts can coexist(164‚ 165).
Three z'iews on the essence of Tium — a) It is identical with God
or the world's existence. This view is absurdly erroneous3 it would
