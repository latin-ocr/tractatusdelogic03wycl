INTRODUCTION. IX

posited. 'l‘hey atre the subject of the accidental qualities which we
perceive3 and though Wyclif calls them a corpus ιιιιιίὴιίιιιῖίίειιηι, they
arc real objective existences‚ and not the atonis of Christ's Body. 'l‘hat
Body, as I pointed out in the Introduction to De Aposlczsicz, is present
there as a symbol -— and is therefore really present with the reality of
u symbol — but not otherwise. Is not this in substance the very same
theory that Wyclif expounds in his later works? There is indeed a com-
plete change of language and style, though even so late as in the tractate
De Aposlczsicz, he continues to employ the term transubstantiation; hut
herc, even froin the very outset, he refuses to admit that anything in
the physica] substance of the bread has been changed.

Such are the most important points in this third volume of Logica;
their bearing both upon what preceded them and what followed, justifies
nic, I think, in setting them before the reader in connected form. Here
and there, we also find certain other allusions, paragraphs upon necessity
and free—will, a word or two against the abuse of ceremonies and the
excess of riches in the (lliurcli, and other signs which show what was
already fermenting in Wyclif's mind; hut they are mere side-issues, and
not (so far as I can sec now) essentially connected with his system.
They will, therefore, be more advantageously considered in their place,
as we go on to the detailed examination of the two last chapters of

Wyclif's Logica.
