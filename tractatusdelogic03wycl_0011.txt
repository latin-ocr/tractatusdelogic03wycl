INTRODUCTION. VII

spiritual, But, if material, how can material substance coexist in the
same space as they? We have to explain how the world fills space,
which is already filled by these punctal realities.

The answer‚ however bold it may seem, is but the outcome of
the difficulty just stated, working in Wyclif's mind, already imbued with
the doctrines I have mentioned above. Matter is made up of atoms, each
atom consisting of a number of points, really distinct from one another,
really without length, breadth, or thickness, and yet really touching each
other. One point cannot make length; two begin to make it; their
essence is to have position of their own, and so, though they touch,
they do not coi'ncide. This non-coincidence is the beginning of length.
Two points do not make a surface, but three do (inchoatively) if the
third is not in a line with the other two3 and this is the beginning of
the plane, and indeed of all surfaces whatsoever. A fourth point not in
the same plane as the other three would be the beginning of volume.
Such are the primordial atoms, which correspond to every point and in
fact are every point in space, for no vacuum is possible. And, were
there any real difference between the reality of mathematical and that
of material points, they would clash together. In short, mathematical
points are real and materia13 therefore, there can be no others. Co-
penetration, Wyclif asserts‚ is an absolute impossibility.

If then a vacuum is inconceivable‚ and space is the same thing as
matter, it follows that, beyond the circumference by which our universe
is bounded, there is no space at all, and that the conception of a straight
line, indefinitely producible, is but a contradiction in terms. The world
being the greatest amount of matter possible, nothing greater can exist3
nor can its size be diminished, for then it would no longer be the
greatest possible.

Here we come to the point where this development of Wyclif’s
Realistic doctrines comes in contact — if not in conflict — with the
dogma of Transubstantiation. If the size of the universe cannot be
diminished, is the annihilation of any part of it admissible? Certainly
not. Resides, to each of those points of which the universe consists‚ it
is essential to have position somewhere; to annihilate one single point
would be to take away, not only its existence, but its very essence too;
or in less Scholastic terminology, it is as impossible to annihilate any
portion of matter as to think away a part of space, which, when once
