XXXVI INTRODUCTION.

IV. conclusion: The φεῖ ot the Nominalistic:
controversy.

With these arguments the third volume of Logica closes somewhat
abruptly. Like the rest of the work, it abounds with arguments of
striking force, as directed against Nominalistic exaggerations; but, on
the other hand, Wyclif's theory of Space and 'I‘ime lies open to a great
number of objections which even his ingenuity is not always able to
refute as satisfactorily as might be desired. In many parts, for modern
readers at least, it has only the interest of an intricate puzzle.

The problem of the Universals, however, though seemingly as dead
as any other philosophical question of the past, deserves a few con-
cluding words. I shall endeavour to show that, under other terms‚ and
until some fuller explanation is found than has yet been given, it is and
will remain for ever the great sturnbling-block in the path of all meta-
physical inquirerS.

When we have the idea of a man, an animal, α substance, we
conceive something that is universally the same in all men, animals, and
substances. Is there anything in the objects of our thoughts that corre-
sponds to it —- anything really universal, universale in re -— or is there
nothing? If we answer in the negative, we hold the Nominalistic position;
if in the affirmative, we are Realists in the old sense of the word.

But to answer affirmatively‚ we must, either implicitly or explicitly‚
lay down the following formula: What is in our mind exists in itself
in tlte same way as it z's in our mind. Lay this down, and you have
Berkeley's denial of matter, German transcendentalism‚ and modern
Idealism in general. Esse est percipi,· to be is to be perceived. Matter
exists as we know it, and as much as we know it; outside of the
knower, it has no being at all. The Non-Ego is posited by the Ego,
and is identical with it. We can have cognizance of the external world
only as a modification of ourselves; and if it exist as we know it, it is
nothing but this modification.

On the other hand, Locke's conceptualism‚ the materialism of cer—
tain XV1111¹³ century philosophers, and the empiricistn and positivism of our
own times, proceed from the negation of this axiom. Locke, in order to
affirm the limits of the human understanding‚ was obliged to deny to

certain ideas any value but such as is merely subjective3 which amounts
