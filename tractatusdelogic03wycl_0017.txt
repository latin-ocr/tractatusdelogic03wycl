to the same conclusion (32). — 6. There are days and nights but one
instant long (as at the poles). These days and nights are part of the
continuity of time, and yet are distinct from the rest of it; therefore they
are real parts, which make up that continuity. And if Time is thus com-
posed, it is easy to show that space is composed likewise (33). -
7. If God, by His almighty Power, created a series of substances each
the size of a mathematical point, and placed them side by side throughout
the whole of space, we should have continuous extension; and nothing
can be brought to prove that what is possible in this case is not a
really existing fact (34). -— Throughout the whole of these arguments, our
author seems at times to take the idea of the absolutely inextended point
— the Nothing of Space — and at others, that of a line divided by
“a quantity that has increased beyond all measure³³. The latter, accord-
ing to modern mathematicians, is not absolutely without length; only
its length is shorter than the shortest line conceivable. Such infinitesimal
magnitudes would indeed be sactors of the line; but would they agree
with Wyclif's conception of the point, as an absolute minimum of bulk?

The line A, divided by 00, gives A; but 2 A, divided in like manner,

ω
, 2A . . .
gives -0—5; the second quantity is mathemat1cally double of the first. But
I leave these considerations to such as are versed in a science which,
since five hundred years, has made such progress as Wyclif never
dreamed of.

Argmnents contra: Aristotle's view. — The difficulties which surround
such a system are of course great and manifold. Aristotle seems against
it; for instance, when he says that the Continuous is infinitely divisible.
But, a) Aristode speaks of that which is continuous to our senses; and
that, so far as our senses can tell, is indeed made up of innumerable
parts. But though infinite for us, they are not so to God. And, h) Ari-
stotle distinctly says that the point is the cause of the line; if so, it
must be its element, and this dictum is quite in Wyclif's favour (35).
The doctrine of indivisible points transcends both our senses and our
imagination. Geometry has nothing to do here, these points are beyond
geometry3 physics are out of court, they belong to metaphysic. God
alone knows how many points go to form a given square, but their

number is not infinite to Him (36). The word ‘Infinite’ is used to denote
