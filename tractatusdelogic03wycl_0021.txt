INTRODUCTION. XVII

drawn from the sides and perpendicularly to them, touch the diagonal
at only one point, he denies it. If it were so, the diagonal would be
only as long as the side. Each parallel intersects the diagonal at several
poinls‚· and this accounts sor the greater length of the latter line. It is
absurd to suppose that two lines which intersect at a very acute angle
do not touch by more points than when they are perpendicular; or
that these parallels would no longer be straight after intersection:
the touching in several points does not change their direction. This
somewhat risky answer is supported by the assertion that the* ultimate
squares (consisting of two points each) are beyond the scope of geometry;
also by some remarks concerning the position of points relatively to the
poles of the world (55, 56), which Ι, not clearly seeing their relevancy
to the subject, prefer to pass over. But I think it is at this part of the
book that we get nearest to the weak point in Wyclii's system: viz.
that two points which touch, i. e. which are at no distance from each
other, are yet not in the same place. I at least can find, even in thought,
no distinction between distance and dzffirence of place.

Wyclif comes to the conclusion that God alone knows what the
real proportion of the diagonal osa square to its side is; for it depends
on the number of points touched by all the intersecting lines parallel
to that side. Geometry may perhaps be true only hypothetically3 it can
prove that the proportion [s ΞήθΧίεῖε in the whole diagonal, but not
that it exists in every part of that line (57). The admission that in every
line there is a certain number of points, of course implies the denial
of all incommensurable quantities; that is, absolutely incommensurable,
though for us and to our way os thinking, they are so: for in every
such case the numbers are infinite to us, and we cannot tell whether
they are odd or even (58—-60).

Another perplexing question concerns the shape of the smallest
figures possible, which consist of a few points only. Are they circles⁷
triangles, spheres, pyramids‚ or what? They may be maintained to be
either any or none of these, and it does not matter, since they are
unimaginable realities in their extreme smallness. We cannot even con-
ceive them distinctly by the intellect, at least in its present state of
union with matter (ΟΦ-63).
