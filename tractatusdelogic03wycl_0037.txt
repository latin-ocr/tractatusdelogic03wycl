being (202, 204). — If a part of the world could become the
whole, then indeed the duration of each part would have separate
existence. But this supposition would be true only in case a part-
of the world were annihilated3 a possibility which Wyclif absolutely
denies (204, 205). — What is extended is not everywhere the same.
True. But is time extended, merely because it is the duration of a
body? No. A man's duration does not change, if he happen to lose
some part of his body. Movement indeed, though inextended in itself,
is extended in the body which moves. But take away any part of a
body in motion, and the whole quantity of the movement is lessened;
the same cannot be said of its duration. Thus we may define Time as
the universal, indivisible and ubiquitous duration of all temporal
things (205, 206).

Another objection7 on which (to judge from the length at which
it is dealt with) Wyclif's opponents seemed to rely a great deal, may
be summed up as follows: VVere time everywhere the same, day would
be night, summer, winter; fair and foul weather would be identical: for
they are parts of time. If Wyclif answers that the same time may be
night in one place and day in another, he is met by the reply: How
then can time be tlt-e same in every place? Where there is night,
there is no day. If time, which is everywhere, be night, then night
is everywhere, or if not⁷ the universals Day and Night have a semi-
spherical shape, and pursue each other round the earth! A body
moving swiftly westward would enjoy a longer day, and night, being
everywhere where day is not, would exist in the interior of every opaque
body. All which is manifestly absurd (200, 201). — The answer is
obviously that day and night are not time, but times. Time happens to
be called day or night according to the circumstance of the presence
or the absence of light (206, 207). Time, i. e. that which is here as
day, may be (andis) elsewhere as night. To say that light pursues
darkness is a mere metaphor which may be admitted or denied as we
choose. That night is semi-spherical, because it occupies a semi-spherical
space, is not more true than that God is round, because He fills the
rotundity of the universe. We ought also to draw a distinction between
natural and artificial night and day. Day exists eternally throughout the
whole world, except in the interior of the earth, or in its shadow. Night

is nearer and nearer to a fixed point on the earth's sursace; it does
