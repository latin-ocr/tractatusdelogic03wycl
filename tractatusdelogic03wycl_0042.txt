XXXVIII INTRODUCTION.

from the effects to their causes; inferences necessarily vague and
indeterminate to a great extent, but none the less true, on account of
the necessary resemblance between the image and that which it images.
Even a shadow, however distorted and indeterminate, bears some
resemblance to the person who casts the shadow. But on the other
hand, things do not exist as they are know by us, if as means a
complete identity of nature between the known and the knowledge
thereos. For that which is the known, is such only from one point of
view, or at best only from a few points: it — i. e. the same that which
(as Wyclif would say) — is the Unknown from millions of other points
of view. All the sophisms in the world cannot get the better of this
distinction, by which all similitude of nature between knowledge and the
known is excluded, whilst similitude of representation is carefully maintained.
But it is precisely this answer, though given by many great minds,
both amongst the ancients and the moderns, that fails to satisfy by its
very moderation. We long to get behind the ‘Thing-in-itself’, and if we
find we cannot, we cry out that there is nothing at all outside the
mirror; or, after many a squabble, weary of disputes, we deny that we
can know anything of that which the images represent, and that all
science ought to be concerned with the images alone and their relations
with each other. And thus the disappointment caused by the perfectly
natural and simple answer given above leads to two contrary excesses
of thought. Some, yearning towards the Absolute, conceive endless systems
by which to go beyond the limitations of the mirror: systems beforehand
doomed to sailure as hopeless as the search after perpetual movement.
Others think that the contrary extreme is the only tenable position, and
reject even such limited inferences as may justly be drawn, nay, that our
very nature compels us to draw. Those aspire to be as Gods; these
are content to thr ow away part of the inalienable birthright of men.
Wyelif‚ Ι think, belongs to the former category. His system was, partly
at least, a mistake; but it was the mistake of a bold, powerful, and com-
prehensive mind. He and all those of his class were philosophers‚ gifted
with a mighty grasp of thought, and immense mental acumem whilst the
others, however ingenious their Subsequent endeavours to reconcile their
principles with facts, must, by the laying down of those very principles,
strike at the root of all philosophy, and even of human reason itself.
