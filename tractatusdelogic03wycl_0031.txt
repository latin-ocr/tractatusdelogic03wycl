INTRODUCTION. XXVII

will exist, the being is in the future (143—145). At different times that
which is white is black, a man differs from himself, &c.; but this implies
no absurdity. Becoming is a change, not of the subject, but of its
‘suchnessf An instantaneous change does not imply an infinitely swist
movement, for the idea of swiftness implies that of time, not of one
instant only (145-147).

A great many fallacies are brought forward against this position,
such as that, v. g.‚ if future whiteness be always predicable of an indi-
vidual, that individual will always be white; so that if at any time he
were black, he would have and not have two essential contradictory
qualities; or that a king cannot have been baptized‚ is, when baptized‚
he was not yet a king; and so on ad infinitum. They all belong to the
class of fallaciae accidentis. “What you have bought, you have eaten;
but you have bought raw meat; therefore you have eaten raw meat.³³
The change from black to white is one, not of nature, but of quality.
The individual differs from himself modally, not essentially. The ebeing a
king’ is in a man a mere accidental quality; the king has been baptized‚
not as a king, but as a man. “He who is now a king, was baptized
when not a king³'‚ is perfectly true. Much depends on the compound
or the divided sense in which terms may be taken. <‘He who is begotten
is David tlte king; David the king and who is begotten belong, as pre-
dicates‚ to the verb is, in the divided, not in the compound sense.
Besides, the act of begetting is not instantaneous; it has many pre-
paratory acts (147—154). —- There are also several theological argu-
ments on p. 150, concerning the possibility of God's assuming the per-
sonality of all creatures, which Wyclif briessy meets by denying (154,
155) in direct opposition to Aquinas (Sum. Th. p. 3³ qu.111. art. 5, 6).

Are all things together, both iu time and place? — Wyclif first
of all gives the arguments contra. If it were so, there would no longer
be any distance between things. The future and the past would exist
eternally3 a man would both exist and not exist in the same (eternal)
time. Again, whatever takes place in any part of space and time, must
take placer there only and only then; its existence cannot possibly be
extended any farther (155). On the other hand, the world is everywhere3
yet the whole world is not in any part of space; and in like manner,
if anything exists at any time, its then existence is true in all tirne; and
so also of space (156). -— Wyclif thinks that this question arises mainly
