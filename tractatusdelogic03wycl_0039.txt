INTRODUCTION. XXXV

represent. What is necessary is that the movement by which time is
measured should be regular. Our author here gives some rather intricate
explanations as to the possibility of a first instant of time, in answer to
the objection that, at the first instant, there is either movement or rest; if
rest, then no time exists; if movement, that implies a Before, and there
is no first instant. The objection might easily be answered by saying
that the first instant is not properly a part of time, but merely a
terminus a quo, a starting-point: only such an answer would contradict
the whole of Wyclifs theory. — A last difficulty, viz, that the world,
immediately after its creation, might have remained at rest for some time,
is met by a flat denial. Rest is a perfection, but not such as can belong
to the world. That it will exist eternally is no contradiction to the asser-
tion that it began to exist; but here there is a very considerable diffi—
culty (non occurrit michi promptus modus explanandi me in ista materia

. ideo transeo pro presenti, p. 224). Evidently Wyclif's system,
positing the necessity of the world's everlasting existence, because each
instant of time requires one that follows, is endangered by the question
whether each instant does not require one to precede it: the old objection
of Aristode, who for that reason asserted the eternity of matter, an
assertion contrary to saith.

Whether the non-being of the world preceded its being. — This
last question arises out of the foregoing one, and seems (though that
would contradict other parts of the system) to lead our author to
a conclusion like that of Aristotle. For if it be answered negatively
by the assertion (225) that the world’s non—being never was, and that
its being was always, this looks a great deal like the doctrine of the
eternity of matter. But in the answers to the objections, we find that
Wyclif distinguishes between to be and to be existing. As I am long
ages before I exist (according to him) so the ideal (though real) being
of the world was eternally before its material existence; being before,
it was without its existence, but not with its non-existence. Of course it
is very hard to get out of the difficulty, which is on a par with the
rest of the system; but the answer satisfies Wyclif's doubts. Ideal being,
that which is the existing world, really was in eternity before the world
existed. It was identical with God's knowledge, so long as God did not
know the world to exist now, i. e. in the first moment of time.
