one is continually brought into being; take the velocity common to each
of these at each instant, and you get the speed of the whole (96).

Here comes a curious passage, in which Wyclif is led to state the
exact rapidity of the swiftest movement possible, viz. one point per
instant. It seems to us that, in continuous movement, whether slow or
quick, one point -— an infinitely small distance — is always passed over
in the infinitely small interval osone instant, This is denied. In all move-
ments which are slower than that of the Equator of the First Mobile,
we have two, three, four . . . . instants during which the point is
motionless, and then passes instantaneously on to the next place, which
is infinitely near (97-99). In all these remarks, and elsewhere, as the
reader will doubtless perceive, there is a dim perception of the non-
equality of infinitesimal quantities; but the state of Mathematics was not
then sufficiently advanced to foster the idea, and Wyclif himself, though
far in advance of his time, was more of a metaphysician than of a
mathematician. His conception, if carried into the field of pure Mathe-
matics, might possibly have had good results; understood in the Realistic.
sense, they came to nothing.

A logical quibble about the possibility of instantaneous change
(whether, between the instant of changing and that of having changed,
there is any interval) brings our author to a short digression upon death,
which takes place in two instants. In the first, the man dies; in the
second, he is dead; for we cannot say, lte is dead at the instant when
he dies, nor lle dies at the instant when he is dead. Other writers
would say that the instant of death is the same in both cases3 but
viewed from different standpoints: as the end of life, and the beginning
of non—life. This, Wyclif says, is impossible (100).

Astronomical objections. —- The assertion that the Equator alone
moves one point per instant is beset with many difficulties. The First
Mobile is a perfect sphere3 its movements therefore ought at all points,
and not only at the Equator, to be uniform. But every point in the First
Mobile does not touch every other: so the smaller circles, making a
shorter journey in the same time, will not require to move so fast. The
circle tangent to the Equator has but one point fewer than the Equator;
performing its journey in the same time, it will remain immobile for one
instant, to make up for the missing point: which of the points is missing
we need not enquire. -- The Poles belong to the great circles,
