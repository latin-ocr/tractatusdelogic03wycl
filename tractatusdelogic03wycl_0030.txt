XXVI lNTRODUCTION.

Is the known wherever its knower is? —- No; for then everything
would be, as God is, everywhere (133, 134). It is objected that every-
thing is truth, and that truth‚ like God, is everywhere. We may, how-
ever, admit this‚ restricting the sense of being in space to filling that space
quantitatively. Thus, granting the force of the argument, we nevertheless
deny it in the signification usually given to words. Christ’s ssody has size in
the Sacrament‚ yet it does not properly fill space3 it is present without
either position or shape. The bread is not annihilated; what remains is a
purely mathematical body, but not nothing; the sacramental sign is the
reality of Christ's Body (134—137). It may be urged that the fact of
movement is not extended in space, and that movement is consequently
everywhere. But local movement is the movement of a body, and must
be extended with that to which it belongs. Virtues, again⁷ exist throughout
the whole man, body and soul; but they are nowhere else but where
their subject is. When a part moves, the whole may be said to move,
it is true; only in a different way (139, 140). Movement thus takes its
determination (individuacionem suam) either from its subject alone, qua
subject, or from the subject with all its integral parts, or from this with
the velocity also taken into account. The third point of view implies the
first and the second3 but not vice versa. Wherever there is 3 more in-
dividual movement, there is also a more universal one3 and in this
sense, movement as a universal, is everywhere, according to Aristotle
(140, 141). God indeed is all truth everywhere3 yet truth, as created, is
not identical with God, and it were a fallacy to draw such an inserence.
The sense of words in these questions depends much on their position
in the sentence. “It is now possible for a given future instant to exist”,
and, “It is possible for a given future instant to exist now³'‚ are two
widely different propositions. God’s knowledge of everything is absolutely
boundless. No time exists for Him. He is means He is yesterday, or He
was to-morrorv,· existing at once in all eternity - an instant to Him.
— He comprises all duration in His being (141——-143); and therefore His
existence is an eternal Now. — Again, we have 3 similar sophism: “That
may necessarily be which cannot be necessarily.’' This is false, but
only when understood of absolute, not of hypothetical necessity, A
future instant is necessarily “about to be³’‚ at a time when it cannot
possibly be “about to be³'. All this is mere foolish subtlety; we go no
farther than to say that, if 31 any moment it is true that 3 given being
