XXXIV INTRODUCTION.

not follow that night moves, but that the movement of something else
(i. e. of the sun) causes night to be nearer. Many quibbles arise from
too lax a use of words. We have day after sunset; an eclipse may cause
night at noon, it being caused by the moon's shadow, not the earth’s;
and the moon, if sels-luminous, would be the cause of day. Every
kind of obscurity may be called night. All these difficulties spring
from different meanings given to the same words. Pmperly, day
exists on earth only when the sun is above a given horizon. But this
is merely incidental‚ and quite irrelevant to what time is in itself
(207—211).

Time implies movement: objections refuted. -—— Time requires the
idea of a Before and an Afterwards‚ which are to be found only in
movement. If all movement were to cease, time would cease too, It is
objected that the mere act of imagining time, without any movement,
would suffice to cause time. Imagination would certainly create time by
the very fact of its activity; but this is itself a movement, and the hypo-
thesis of a bodily faculty working without motion is utterly absurd
(211—215). At this juncture, Wyclif enters into a digression respecting
the happiness of the Blessed in Heaven (215, 216) and the misery of
the damned (217), which is relevant to the question in so sar as, po—
siting eternal time, Wyclif must posit eternal movement of some kind. He
asserts that all movement cannot cease in the world3 successive know—
ledge, and (I may add) the feelings of pleasure and of pain, require it
(217). Whether the world will continue to move after the Day of Judg-
ment is not so certain. The changelessness which follows upon the
attainment of the end of any being, may be called rest, and such rest
is not opposed to successive motion. But the rest of a being that can
and does not move must be denied sor many reasons, one of which is that,
applied to the world, such rest would neither be successive nor instan-
taneous; neither in {ime nor in any partos time. Lines, δια, may
begin and end instantaneously; but this cannot prove that a substance may
do so too.

If it be true that the hand of a clock, turning round in exactly
24 hours, would measure time as well as the First Mobile, we have a
very slow movement equal to one excedingly swift, as regards time;
therefore movement and time are not interdependent. —— This objection‚
Wyclif admits, contains a point which the imagination is unable to
