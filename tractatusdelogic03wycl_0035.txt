is not in God's power that Ι (10 1101 exist. But when must anything
exist? At a moment known to God (179—183). The simultaneity of life
-and death would, as already stated, require thern both to take place at
the very same instant. Time exists‚ but its parts do not all exist now,
only one at a time. Now is but 0116 mode of an existence which not
now does not destroy. An instant then, non), and to conte exists dif—
ferently, but cannot at any time be called simply non-existent, Antichrist
must come: therefore he has come . . . in the future. That is a modal,
but a real existence. It was never true that I am not. To exist and not
to exist are contradictories; they may be true of the same being, but
not in the same Now. God knows past, present and future things with
the very same knowledge, yet this does not argue sameness in the
object known. Light is not affected by the presence or the absence
of the object illuminated. God may know present and future things as
past, if they exist in time; things eternal are eternally present; such, for
example, as the archetypes of what was, is, or is to be (183—-188).
Here Wyclif again returns to his adversaries' favourite argument, viz.
that black is white, and all contraries identical. But one remark of his
is worth noticing. A proposition may be true, and yet false at any finite
part of time; as, for instance: <All the instants of time exist³. This is
true only for and in endless time (188-191).

An eternal antecedent does not necessarily cause its consequent in
time. — If it did, all things would be eternal. God eternally knows and
causes all that which exists temporally. The extrinsic act of God, termin-
ated in the creature, is, as tlzns terminated, neither eternal nor neces-
sary; the intrinsic act of His being is eternal and changeless (191, 192).

A cause produces its effect before that effect em‘sts. That is, before
its existence it is producing it, but not now3 in the future. The ideal
being of the effect depends upon its cause, and is produced by it
before the moment when its real existence has to be actuated. On the
other hand, cause, qua cause, and effect, are simultaneous. Many things
are neither instantaneous nor temporal; v. g., certain eternal truths, and
beings of which the existence is intermittent. Wyclif here wonders how
the writers of his time can oppose his system, which is confirmed by
the very expressions they employ; and he blesses God, who has enlightened
him that he may escape the difficulties in which they are entangled

(192—195). — The necessity of sin depends on our own free-wilh the
