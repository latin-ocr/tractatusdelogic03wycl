XXIV INTRODUCTION.

being; seconAEy, as substance, or the subject of various attributes; and
thirem, as matter, being emended, and possessing form (119). Thus
matter, form, and the compound are the same being, the same essence,
and not separate realities (120). This, in fact though not in words, is
the denial of matter and form in the usual Scholastic sense of “two
distinct realsties, whereof the latter determines the former and the former is
determinable by the latter which at the same time is sustained in existence
by the former: both incomplete in themselves and apart‚ but together
making up the complete material substance'’. In Wyclif's system, there
is no need to admit such dualism. The simple inextended point may be
either fire, air, water, or earth; this possibility is matter. It is actually
one or other of the four3 the igneity‚ aeriality, δια, which it possesses
is its form. And the point itself‚ as being thus whilst able to be other-
wise, is the compound. Denying the existence of extended atoms‚ the
writer, whose system here does not differ much from that of other
Atomists (i. e. so far as his way of explaining matter and form goes),
escapes from many difficulties which beset the path of those who admit
that the primordial atom is extended. But there are others.

Ohjections. —— It is asserted that matter and form, since they are
parts of the whole compound; cannot be identical with the whole. But
Wyclif notes that they are not quantitative parts —— as, for example,
the head and the heart in man —- but qualitative merely, like rationality
and animality‚ for instance. The whole man is reasonable and is animab
the whole man is not at once head and heart (121). We have thus a
sort of trinity in which matter, form and compound, identical in one
sense, are different in another: but Wyclif takes great care to point
out the difference between this trinity and that of the soul, or of God
(121, 122). — If matter, as Wyclif asserts (121) is eternal‚ form is so
too, being identical with it; and thus the world is eternal. But here he
denies that the radical identity of matter, form, and compound with Being,
renders these three identical with each other. Man is reasonable, man
is animab yet rationality and animality differ. All that is true, is good;
yet truth is not the same thing as goodness. And Wyclif points to the
Incarnation, as affording us another instance of a similar fallacy (123). ——
On the supposition that every essence is in reality everywhere the same,
we have all sorts os contradictions. The answer to this is that contra-

dictions may coexist in the same subject, either at different times, or
