XVI INTRODUCTION.

conclusion (50, 5Ι); and that our author's system would imply the denial,
not only of Euclid's definition of angles, but of the whole of his treatise
on the subject. (Here, by the way, we may note how quietly the tri-
section of an angle is taken for granted “secundum doctrinam prime
Vitulonis³³, i. e. Vitellio, the famous Mediaeval mathematician and optician
c‘que docet angulum rectum datum in tres partes dividere³‘, whereas all
mathematicians are at present agreed that such trisection is impossible.
As, however, Ι have not been able to get a sight of Vitellio’s works,
though living in the very city in which he wrote them,1 I am not quite sure
that what he teaches is anything more than a mere practical way of divid-
ing an angle into three parts, without any claim to absolute exactitude.)

Wyclif replies that, as regards Euclid⁷s definition of the angle —
the meeting of two lines — this is merely a genetic, not an essential
definition. Euclid indeed says what causes an angle; but that is not the
angle itself. As to the rest, the answer is ready: Euc'lid’s theory con-
cerns only sensible angles, not such as are found amongst points which
touch; such, for instance, as form triangles which have sides only two
points long, and of which the apex is an angle which cannot be
bisected7 &c. —— All this cannot be imagined, and should, therefore, be
denied from a merely geometrica] point of view (52, 53).

We come now to what is perhaps the strongest mathematical ob-
jection to Wyclif's system. According to him, points are placed as fol-
lows, in a small square of say, 25 points only3 I have added the con-
necting hyphens in the subjoined figure to show which points touch, and
which do not touch. As is seen, the points on the diagonals
do not touch directly‚ and there are no more points on
the diagonal than on the side of a square. This, true
for the given square, all but infinitesimally small, will also

any square (containing an equal number of points) will be equa] to its
side, the greater to the less: which is absurd (53, 54). — Wyclif’s
reply admits as an evident fact that the diagonal of a square is longer
than its side. But when he comes to the statement that parallel lines,
