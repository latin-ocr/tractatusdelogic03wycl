VIII INTRODUCTION.

created, is absolutely necessary. A further proof is in the impossibility
of a vacuum: if a pieee of bread be annihilated, what remains in its
place? Nothing thinkable3 and, therefore, annihilation is unthinkable too.

Wyclif is thus forced to deny that anything can be annihilated,
even by Almighty Power, even absolutely considere& and here we see
the profound difference which separates him from the general opinion
of Scholastic philosophers and theologians, who distinguish between
what is possible to Omnipotence, irrespectively of God's other attributes,
but are not all osone mind as to whether annihilation is absolutely
impossible. They would willingly grant the truth of Milton’s lines in the
second book of Paradise Lost:

. How He can
Is doubtful; that He never will, is sure.
But Wyclif has no doubt at all on the matter.

Now, in the doctrine of Transubstantiation, it is affirmed that the
bread ceases to exist. This (though some Doctors of great note, Aquinas
amongst others, explain it in a different manner> certainly seems to point
to annihilation, as was very probably admitted by Wyclif⁷s Nominalistic
opponentS. At any rate, the assertion that the whole substance of the
bread ceases to exist at a given instant — both as to its substantial
qualities and the underlying substratum of those qualities — could, in
Wyclif's system, be understood only as the annihilation of the atoms of
which it consists. This had to be denied. The bread, it was affirmed,
ceased to exist as bread,· in its place there remained a body that
Wyclif (no doubt out of respect for the dogma which he still seemed
to admit) called a corpus mathematicmn. I say, estill seemed to admit³3
for, as we have seen, this corpus mathematicum, quite orthodox enough in
the ordinary sense of the words, is nothing else but the atoms‚ or mathe-
matical points, of which the bread consists, just as they were before.
Any one who will read p. 137 of the present volume will, Ι think, be
convinced that the successive stages of Wyclif’s opinions in this matter,
as given by Wodeford (see De Benedicta Iucarnacz'one, ed. ΜΓ. Harris,
[nl. IX.) were successive only in the mode of expression, not in the
thing itself. The same esse, he says, which was previously that of bread,
becomes sacramentally the Body of Christ. True, he also says that it
does not remain bread after consecration, and explains himself no
