that some os them predominate in certain of the elements, and others
in certain others (82——85).

What is llze measure of z'elocily of motion? — Not, says Wyelis,
the space gone over by the mobile in a given time. This seems para-
doxical; but an example, given directly afterwards, shows that our author
is thinking, notos the distance in length, but of the whole sursace gone
over. A large body and a small one, though moving with equal specd‚
will go through very unequal spaces in the same time. What measures
the motion of any body is the point of maximum swiftness, which in
every case must exist, and must exist somewhere at the surface of the
moving body; there is also a point where the movement is reduced to
a minimum, but Wyclif, somewhat unaccountably‚ restricts this proposition
to living beings that move (86). Now the measure of velocity of a body
is the line described by the point which moves fastest (87, 94).

General arguments against lVyclif’s posiz‘iou. -« The First
Mobile, being the outermost sphere, and having no space beyond it,
can describe no line at all; planets have many movements, and no point
can be said to describe them all at the same time. Again, if we suppose
a given length passed over in a given time, this may be done by
mobiles of infinitely varying velocities‚ which would all have this length
and time sor the measure of their respective velocities. And we can con-
ceive the case of a body continually losing its swiftest point by the
very fact os its movement: which would refute the assertion that every
mobile must have such a point (87, 88). This last objection is urged,
from p. 89 to p. 92, in a long argument which I have been utterly
unable to follow. Wyclif then points out that the reason for which some
deny the general idea of movement (abstracting from its rapidity‚ and
allowing a general measure of velocity for the whole mobile) is in reality
the doctrine of Nominalism. Nominalists do not want to admit a universal
idea of movement which exists even in bodies at rest, when acted upon
by contrary forces (94). The movement of a body is as swift as that
of its swiftest part3 this swiftness is the measure of the whole (ila). As
to the objections, that of the First Mobile has no value whatever. What
that sphere describes may not be formally called a line, but it is equi-
valent to a line. Planets have not many movements‚ but one which is
tantamount to many (unus motus, habens racionem diversorum motuum) (95).
If, in the last case, the point os greatest velocity is continually lost, a new
