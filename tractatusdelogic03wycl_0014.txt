X INTRODUCTION.

Locaz propositions. Place may be taken to mean merely position (1).
The world consists of atoms, cannot be increased nor diminished in size,
nor moved, nor changed in shape. The whole of space is the whole
world3 partial spaces are made up of points. To each point corresponds
a place, which is fixed, whereas the points are all movable, and may
enter it, one after the other (1, 2). It is a mere relation of distance
from the poles and the centre of the world (3). The universe is the
common place of everything3 yet each of its parts has its own partial
site (3, 4). Two bodies may thus be in the same place in one sense,
and in another, in quite different and separate places (5). Site and situa-
tion are not identical, except at the poles and at the centre (6). Posi-
tion depends upon the distance of anything from the centre (6, 7).
Animals, like the world, have in themselves these differences of position:
above, below, back, front, right and left (7— 11).

Movemeut defined and divided. Movement is the ‘form³‚ or per-
fection, by which the mobility of a mobile becomes actualized; local
movement is but one of its many divisions (11). Local movement
implies a mover which is other than the thing moved; this leads us to
admit a First Motor‚ motionless, indivisible‚ everlasting (12, 13). Local
movement may be straight, circular, &. (14, 15). Can we say that the
same body has two different movements at once (16—18)? Not according
to strict logic; but one movement may be considered as the combination
of two others, and rest, as the result of two equal and contrary mo-
tions (18—23). Every change which makes a body to differ from what
it was, deserves to be called movement in a wide sense; and in a sense
still wider, the activity of the intellect and the action of God upon His
creatures‚ is movement (24). The swiftness of the movement of a body
is represented by the space it would pass through in a given time, if
not prevented. The impediment only counteracts the external effects
which movement tends to cause, and therefore must count for nothing,
even when so great as totally to destroy the effect (25). Supposing
the sun to have a retrograde movement on the celestial sphere as rapid
as the forward motion of the sphere itself, there would be no apparent
motion of the sun from east to west, though it would move from north
to south (26). Wyclif here alludes to the fact that the sun is higher in
the sky in summer than in winter, The effect of which he speaks would
be produced, in the language of modern astronomy‚ if the earth, whilst
