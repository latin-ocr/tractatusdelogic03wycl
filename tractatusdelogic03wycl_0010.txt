VI INTRODUCTION.

a study of works of the kind. The wild boldness of the conclusions
reached, the impossibility of conceiving what Wyclif himself declares
over and over again to be beyond the scope of mathematical specu-
lation, although it deals with Space and Time; above all, the strange-
ness of Wyclif's standpoint, so foreign to all our modern ideas of
Natural Philosophy — will often, no doubt, confuse the reader, and
lead him to pass over unnoticed the many excellent qualifies, both of
subtlety and of depth of thought, with which this volume abounds. Ι
myself, though long engaged in the preparation of this edition, thought
at first that the two tractates on Space and Time were merely side-
issues that might have been lopped off from Wyclif's philosophy without
disadvantage to the whole. But on further consideration my opinion has
been very much modified. His theory of Time and Space appears to
me now as a logical result, partly of his Realism, partly of his doctrine
concerning maxima and minima; and this same theory is, I think, the
root from which his doctrines on the Eucharist necessarily sprang. It
is thus essentially linked with his fundamental doctrines; but it is at the
same time a link, indissolubly connecting them with the further develop-
ments of his theological ideas.

When Wyclif affirmed the objective reality of all universals, he at
once encountered a considerable difficulty in dealing with the phenomenon
of extension. Nominalists‚ if consistent, say that not only points, but
lines, surfaces, and even volumes, are all entia rationis - mere fig-
ments of our mind. For a volume is a Universal -— One in Many
— containing an infinite multitude of surfaces; a surface, again, is the uni-
versal of the line; and the line is in like manner the universal of the
point. And for the same reason that they denied this reality, Wyclif was
obliged to maintain it. As to points, they must be real things too, though
not universal, since the line is nothing more than a series of points,
and is made up of them: at all events, being something in that which
is real, they must be real too. Now, as we have seen in the two former
volumes, Wyclif abjures the doctrine of the indefinitely great, and roundly
asserts that there is a maximum and a minimum for all things. A maxi-
mum of size: therefore space is not absolutely infinite, but only rela-
tively so — relatively to us. There is also a minimum of size‚ which of
course is the point. Now, what are those real countless points, which
fill all space, and of which all space consists? They are surely not
