XXXII INTRODUCTION.

fact of its happening, on the will of God. -- The use of the present
for the past and the suture cannot be blamed as an abuse of terms‚
nor as the denial of expositorial syllogisms. No logician should use it
thus when he is likely to be misunderstood through ignorance; but it is
allowed to speak otherwise to philosophers than to the common people.
Neither the expositorial syllogism, nor any other, is denied by Wyclif's
theory, which on the contrary admits many forms of syllogism that others
deny. -— A curious difficulty is raised here by the adversaries (195).
Wyclif is certain that he has had no son. Yet perhaps his son is wiser
than he; for he possibly may have a son yet. If this son ‘will be’, then ‘he
is’ according to the theory which extends the future to the present.
Wyclif denies this conclusion, unless it is certain that he will have a
son. At first sight it does not clearly appear how this can be denied
in the form given. “Filius meus ex mihi dubio esset sapiencior1ne.’'
A supposition that depends upon another supposition is quite thinkable.
But we must here remember Wyclif's doctrine -- that the distinction
between extrinsic and intrinsic possibility has no real foundation3 that a
seemingly possible creature is in reality impossible, if God has chosen
never to create it (See Logica vol. II.‚ [κέν. XXIV). We have the right
to deny the possibility of Wyclif’s ever having a son in the future,
unless we are certain that he will have one. Perhaps the individual in
question is possible; God knows; but we know nothing at all about
him (195—199).

Time is the same everywhere. —— Our author begins by enumerating
the arguments contrary to his own opinion (199—202), and then refutes
them one by one. Even if the world were not everywhere, it would not
follow that time is not everywhere. But as a fact, the world being
(partially) in each and all os its parts, that argument must fall to the
ground (202). — It is [lenied that the world has any unity whatever,
being a mere aggregate; and time, an accident belonging to the world,
cannot have more unity than its subject. But Wyclif points out that the
laws of nature give unity to this aggregate, just as political laws give
unity to an aggregate or assembly of men. Resides, the world, not·-
withstanding changes, remainsthe same in its efficient cause — God
—- and also in its material cause — the atoms of which it consists.
If we grant that the world is animated, its unity becomes much more

evident3 now, wc have many proofs that it really isan animated
