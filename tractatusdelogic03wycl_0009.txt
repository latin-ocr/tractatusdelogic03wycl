'INTRODUCTION

I. Preliminary Remarks.

With the third volume of Logica, Wyclif's first great philosophical
work'comes to a close. All that should be said as regards the genuineness
of the work and its date has already been said in the Introduction to
Vol. Ι, and there is no need to repeat it here. As to the state of the
manuscript, a few words may perhaps be allowed. Very illegible from
the beginning, as stated in the Introductions to Vols. Ι and II, it becomes
worse and worse, sometimes intolerably so, as it approaches the end.
This may account for, and to some extent excuse, the numerous short-
comings of the present edition, which no one can regret more than the
editor himself.

I wish to take this opportunity of again most sincerely thanking
all those who have aided me in the work; especially Dr. Furnivall, the
Founder of the Wyclif Society; and Mr. Matthew, whose notes have
inore than once been of great service.

The two chapters of Wyclif's book which make up the present
volume were also copied as separate tractates. The last chapter,
however, dealing with time, is quite distinct from the treatise De Ilzdz'vi—
ditacione Temporis, not yet published. Before entering into a detailed
examination of the contents of these two chapters, I think it advisable
to notice several matters of importance which may strike the reader on
a perusal of the whole.

Logica will be found unattractive, especially by such as have not made
