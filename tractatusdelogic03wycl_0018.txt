XIV INTRODUCTION.

all that goes beyond our power of conception, even though the thing
be not infinite in itself. A number, therefore, which is infinite to one man
will be finite to another; and none is infinite to Divine Intelligence. This
evidently ssows from Wyclif’s conception of maxima and minima. There
is a fixed number of all things —- even of the points in a line —- which,
infinite to us, is finite to God; and no straight line can be infinitely
long (37, 38>-

As this conception of the Infinite may give rise to the inquiry
how far our author is in agreement with the majority of Scholastic
philosophers‚ a short digression is not out of place here, and I shall
proceed briefly to state the points on which there is the least contradic»
tion among Schoolmen in this matter.

The Infinite means ‘that beyond which nothing greater can be
conceived², whether by human thought, or by any other intelligence‚
however perfect. If no substance or being can be conceived greater, it
is the Absolute Infinite— God; if no accident, then it is the relative
Infinite — of quantity (multitude or magnitude) or of quality. The Infi-
nite cannot be made up of finite parts; it is not the mere negation‚ but
the negation of a negafion, and thus has a positive meaning. Infinite
magnitude of matter is impossible; so is an infinite number, an infinite
multitude, and a movement infinitely swift. Infinite imperfection or badness
is also inadmissible; for it would totally destroy any substance in which
it inhered; but qualities that denote nothing but perfection, such as force,
life, duration, ἃς. must be admitted in God; in the human soul too,
but only from a certain point of view, “secundum quid''. This Infinite
“secundum quid²³ is in general predicated of that which is finite in every
sense but one; as, e. g.‚ the two halves of an infinite line, or of infinite
space. In this sense, and from the point ofview from which it is finite,
one infinite may be greater than another. - Clearly the term, as
employed by Wyclif, has quite another meaning, unless when he applies
if to God.

Oly'ections based upon geometry. —-— If WycliPs theory be true, then
the number of points is the same in two lines, one of which is double
of the other. For two mobiles, passing over each of them, one double
as fast as the other, correspondingly to the length of the lines, will go
over them in the same number of instants, and therefore that same
number of points will be passed in that time. The difficulty is solved
