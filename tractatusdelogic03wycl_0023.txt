INTRODUCTlON. XIX

as distinguished from mere mechanical mixtures, the elements do not
exist any longer actually, but only potentially; that is, they may, under
certain circumstances, again be extracted from the compound. Their
position, as given in their text-books of Philosophy at the present day,
is that in a mere mixture - of hydrogen and oxygen, for example —
both elements‚ though mingled together, do really and actually exist;
but that as soon as the mixture is exploded they no longer exist in the
compound —— water -- except in this sense, that the water may be
analyzed into its constituents. Of course, so long as it is not possible
to show them the atoms coexisting side by side, they are free to main-
tain that their existence is only potential. But, even during the Middle
Ages, the Scotists protested loudly against such an assumption, of which
nothing could prove the truth.

Wyclif takes the side of the Scotists, as he was bound by his
system to do. He gives us a disquisition on the conditions necessary
to chemical combination, which seem to be almost the same as those
now posited by modern science (74); and then he observes that
Aristotle’s assertion of the non-existence of the elements in a compound
ought not to be taken literally. Even Averrho'e's’ position, viz. that
they exist, but with less intensity of being, would be contrary to the
system of inextended points; compenetration being impossible, nothing
can interfere with their intensity of existence (75). With yet greater decision
he opposes the hypothesis of merely potential existence. If the reason that
there is a form which unites the elements in one compound (making the
elemental forms to exist no longer) were valid, then in a human body,
of which the soul is the form, nothing would remain of the body but
its primal matter; and that body, so complicated in all its parts, would
be simpler than an element (76). It may be worthy of remark that this
conclusion, strange as it may seem, is even now admitted and taught
by that branch of Neo-Scholasticism which adheres strictly to the teaching
of St. Thomas. When the human form, or soul‚ departs, what (they
are asked) takes place in the body? Do not all the elements exist in it
again? And if they exist there at once with all their differences, can it
be that they were only potentially there before? The answer given is
that after the soul’s departure, a new, but transient form comes to give
being to the body; it is called the cadaveric form, forma cadaverica,

and precedes the various forms of decomposing matter, which succeed
