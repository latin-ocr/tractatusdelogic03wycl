make all things eternal, and destroy all certitude as to the duration of
things (165, 166).

b) Nothing is, but everything either was or will be. This cuts
short disputes as to the existence of things during an infinitely brief
interval. But then, what never is, never was or will be. To God’s
knowledge nothing is in the future, so He would know, for instance,
movement to exist, and it would not be true. One honr must be the
double of half an hour; if so, there must come an instant at which this
is true in the present: i. e. when half is past, half future, and the
whole honr partly one and partly the other. Present may indeed be
taken in a wider sense than one single instant. Here Wyclif shows
clearly that, in the same way as he assumes the existence of separate
individual points as realitieS, so he also assumes the real existence os
instants‚ joined together to form time, shorter or longer, but also really
existing in another time which includes both past and future. Instead,
therefore, of a century being a present which is fictitious, consisting only
of indivisible instants before and after each of which there is the non-
existing past and the not yet existent future, the whole century forms a
real present, though real in another sense than that of the instant which
is now. And Wyclif adds that, if this be not admitted, he does not see
how the sacramenta] words, for instance, “Hoc est corpus meum³³‚ can
be true. Only an infinitesimal part of the proposition would exist; the
whole, never; and consequently it never would he true. To say, “Nothing
that is past or future exists³³, is in reality to destroy time. God’s immut-
able knowledge of things, and His free-will, are both contrary to such
a supposition. Christ, in the Divine Essence of the word, saw men long
before their temporal existence; but He saw them as existing‚ and they
did truly exist in the reality of long centuries of the future. And thus
He is rightly called, Son of David, Son of Abraham, in this real exten-
sion of time, by which David and Abraham come to be coexistent with
Him. Has a posthumous child no father at all? None, unless we grant
the real simultaneity of its existence now with the past in which its
father lived (166—170).

c) Time, though a successive quantity, can be lengthened out inde-
finitely by Almighty power, so that one instant would he equal to ages.
This is possibly the doctrine of the aevum or instans angelicum, familiar
to Mediaeval Schoolmen, which some of them may have supposed
